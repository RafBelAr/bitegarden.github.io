We have released **version 2.25** of the [Security Plugin for SonarQube](sonarqube-security)!
<br/>

This new version adds the CWE Top 25 **On the Cusp** report, which is a complementary list to the CWE Top 25 of the most dangerous software weaknesses. It highlights vulnerabilities that did not make it to the main list but still represent significant security risks. The "On the Cusp" vulnerabilities are close to meeting the criteria for inclusion in the main list and are considered important because they may become more prevalent in the future.
When it comes to application code and software development, understanding and addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial to ensuring robust security. While they may not be exploited as frequently as those in the Top 25, they represent emerging or less common weaknesses that attackers can still take advantage of.
Staying informed about these weaknesses also helps organizations anticipate possible future trends in software vulnerabilities.
