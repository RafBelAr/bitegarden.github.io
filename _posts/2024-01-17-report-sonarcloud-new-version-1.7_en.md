We have a new version of the [bitegarden Report for SonarCloud](/sonarcloud-report)!

This version adds 4 new reports, as we did in SonarQube plugin:
- Vulnerabilities, Bugs and Code Smells Summary Report
- Security Hotspots Summary Report
- Vulnerabilities, Bugs and Code Smells Breakdown Report
- Security Hotspots Breakdown Report

<br />

That report will show you the information about only Issues or only Hotspots in your projects.
