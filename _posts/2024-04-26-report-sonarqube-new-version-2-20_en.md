We have a new version of [Report Plugin for SonarQube](/sonarqube-report). **Version 2.20** which changes the aesthetics of the report selection page and adds the possibility of **selecting** which information will be displayed in the reports. We tell you about it below.

This version modifies **the way reports are generated**. From now on, you will be able to select the following report types:

**Option 1:** Executive Report (PDF).

**Option 2:** Summary Report (PDF).

**Option 3:** Full Detailed Report (PDF).

**Opción 4:** Informe Excel (XLSX).

**Option 5:** Customised Report (ODT).
<br>

And a selector is added as to what will be shown in the report you download:

- Bugs
- Vulnerabilities
- Code Smells
- Security Hotspots

In addition to being able to configure (both globally and at project level) that it will be enabled by default!
