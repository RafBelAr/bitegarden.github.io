Today we present the new version (2.1) of our [**Report Plugin for SonarQube&trade;**](/sonarqube-report).

This version adds **2 new PDF reports** to extract more information from the project, thus complementing the single-page executive summary.

It also includes **support for branches** so you can generate the report of the desired branch, and not just the main one.

And another highly desired functionality: the ability to configure the **footer logo** has been implemented, to make the report more corporate.

This version has everything you need: **simple PDF report**, **complete PDF report** or **ODT custom report**.
