We have released a new version (2.17) of the Security Plugin for SonarQube&trade;.

**The version adds support for CWE Top 25 (2023) for both sections, SonarQube UI and PDF generation.**

The latest “2023 Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses” (CWE Top 25) list was released 
on June 21, 2023, on the [CWE website](https://cwe.mitre.org/top25/archive/2023/2023_top25_list.html).

The CWE Top 25 is calculated by analyzing public vulnerability data in the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology’s (NIST) U.S. National Vulnerability Database (NVD) for root cause mappings to CWE weaknesses for the 
previous two calendar years. These weaknesses lead to serious vulnerabilities in software. An attacker can often 
exploit these vulnerabilities to take control of an affected system, steal data, or prevent applications from working.

The 2023 CWE Top 25 also incorporates updated weakness data for recent Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE®) 
records in the dataset that are part of Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)’s Known Exploited 
Vulnerabilities Catalog (KEV).

Trend analysis on vulnerability data like this enables organizations to make better investment and policy decisions 
in vulnerability management. Many professionals who deal with software will find the CWE Top 25 a practical and 
convenient resource to help mitigate risk.
