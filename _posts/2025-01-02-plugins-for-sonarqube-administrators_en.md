The administrator is essential for a SonarQube instance to function properly and for users to work normally and focus on what really matters: **developing quality and secure software**. When a SonarQube instance is configured correctly, the effectiveness of the tool is fully assured and the collaboration of the development team is efficient. So, in order for a **SonarQube administrator** to get to this point, at bitegarden we have developed a series of plugins to make your day-to-day life easier. 

But before I show you these plugins, letâ€™s review what are the skills of a SonarQube administrator. 

<br>

<h2>What skills should a SonarQube administrator have?</h2>

**- Monitor and maintain projects**: Manage multiple projects, maintenance... a SonarQube administrator must have sufficient knowledge to perform this type of task.

**- Automate tasks**: If you can automate tasks for both yourself and your users, you should do them. For example, implementing an inspection circuit continues to place SonarQube at the centre of the analysis.

**- Improve the visibility of information**: Have quick access to key statistics for projects and, where appropriate, provide that information to users.

**- Manage plugins**: Install and configure plugins to extend the functionality of instances. Also, maintain and update those installed plugins to work properly.

<h2>Which plugins can help the administration of SonarQube?</h2>

And now yes, after analyzing the main features we show you the plugins. Some are related to tasks mentioned above, such as plugin management or global instance management. 

**- Universal Plugin Manager for SonarQube Server**: This is a plugin developed by the bitegarden team that allows administrators to easily manage the plugins installed on a SonarQube instance. With this solution you can install individual plugins (with jar files), update them and uninstall them. 

[Here we leave the page](/sonarqube-upm) of this plugin if you want to expand the information. 

**- Control Center for SonarQube Server**: This solution will allow you to keep your SonarQube instance in order while allowing you to see the most interesting information quickly. With Control Center for SonarQube you will be able to filter projects and perform mass actions.

**- Project Tag for SonarQube**: It is the label management solution for the SonarQube instance. A few weeks ago [we wrote an article](/what-is-a-tag-in-sonarqube) about the importance of tags in SonarQube. With the Project Tag for SonarQube you can easily and automatically set up project tags.
