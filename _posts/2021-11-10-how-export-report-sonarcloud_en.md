If you are using [**SonarCloud**](https://sonarcloud.io/) to evaluate your code you will have on more than one occasion been looking for a way to be able to **download your project reports from SonarCloud**.

In **SonarCloud** you have the possibility to view all the problems related to your code (bugs, vulnerabilities, code smells, duplications, security problems, ...) but unfortunately it is not possible by default to download all this information.

Precisely for this reason we have decided to expand its functionality and make life easier for the software development teams, DevOps and Project Managers. Like? Through the [**bitegarden Report for SonarCloud**](/sonarcloud-report).

## How to download a report from SonarCloud

Download the [**Report plugin for SonarCloud**](/sonarcloud-report) (or more precisely, command line application) and generate all the reports in PDF from SonarCloud, from now on you will always have all the information on quality and code security of your project.

## Types of reports available for Sonarcloud

You have different types of reports available, from the **executive** one that summarizes all the important metrics on a single page to a **complete report** with all the details of the evidence found (bugs, vulnerabilities, security hotspots and code smells).
