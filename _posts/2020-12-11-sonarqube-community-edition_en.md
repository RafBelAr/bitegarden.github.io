The [**Community Edition of Sonarqube**](https://www.sonarqube.org/success-download-community-edition/) is the **opensource and free version** of Sonarqube, and it is also usable for commercial use ([click on the following link to know what Sonarqube is and what it is used for](/static-code-analysis-with-sonarqube)).

The **Community Edition of Sonarqube** provides developers and development teams with an integrated continuous inspection solution for code review. Its unique methodology enables developers to improve maintainability, reliability, and security in **15 programming languages** ​​through direct integration with popular IDEs, build tools, and workflows.

The languages ​​included are: **Java, JavaScript, C #, TypeScript, Kotlin, Ruby, Go, Scala, Flex, Python, PHP, HTML, CSS, XML, VB.NET**.

Deep code analysis helps track hard-to-find bugs and quality issues. Advanced, high-precision techniques such as data flow analysis maximize productivity by reducing false positives.

To pay even more attention to the mistakes that are being made while writing the code, it is possible to use [**Sonarlint**](https://www.sonarlint.org/), a little gem of SonarSource. **Sonarlint** is an extension for IDE's that helps to see the incidents of the code before analyzing it with SonarQube.

This amazing tool helps developers create cleaner code as they work.
