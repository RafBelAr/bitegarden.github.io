We have more updates! We have released a new version (1.5) of the **Security Report for SonarCloud**.

This release adds to ISO5055 Report a breakdown of Failed, Passed and Not Supported CWEs, as we did in SonarQube version.

Also, we added the possibility to enable/disable the Not Passed CWE in the **ISO 5055 PDF Report**.
