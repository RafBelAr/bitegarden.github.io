**bitegarden** team never stop developing new features, and now is time for the new version of the [**Report Plugin 2.2 for SonarQube**](/sonarqube-report).

This version includes:

-- a new section in the evidence reports with details of the **Security HotSpots**

-- the report indicates the lines where the **Security HotSpots** have been detected.

In addition, the bug that prevented generating the report for projects with more than 10,000 pieces of evidence has been solved.

**Enjoy the most complete version ever!**
