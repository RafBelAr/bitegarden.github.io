We have more updates! We have released a new version (1.4) of the **Security Report for SonarCloud**.

This release gives you the option to add **two new fields** in PDF reports.

This update has its origin in that some of the users asked us if we could put some extra fields...And here they are!

Now you can put a customizable **tag** with the **description you want**. In the image below you have an example. As you will see we have added an extra field called *Optional extra label* and with the description *Bitegarden Realese Test*
