We have published version 2.6 of the [Security Plugin for SonarQube](sonarqube-security) that allows to know the fulfillment of the security standards (OWASP, CWE/SANS).

The plugin incorporates for the first time the ability to download a PDF report of **compliance with the CWE Top 25 standard**, something that could be done before for the OWASP standard and that you have sued us in many cases. We have also updated the <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/top25/archive/2021/2021_cwe_top25" target=_blank> **CWE Top 25 standard to version 2021**</a> that has been published during the month of July 2021.

Internal changes are also included to improve dependencies. 

## What's new in the Security Plugin for SonarQube

**New features and changes**

-- PDF generation for the CWE Top 25 standard.

-- Support for CWE Top 25 of 2021.

-- The severity icons have been changed to the standard SonarQube icons.

-- At the bottom of the plugin the link to technical support is included.

**Error correction**

-- Only the branch is displayed on the first page of the PDF.
