We have just released *[bitegarden Overview Report for SonarCloud&trade;](/sonarcloud-overview)* version 1.2.

This new version includes amazing new features to improve the information available in the report:

### Health Rating

A new ***health rating will be available in the overall section page*** (the first page), including the number of projects 
that are passing the quality gate and the projects that are failing. 

The health rating is the ratio of projects that have a Passed Quality Gate:

-- A: > 80%

-- B: > 60%

-- C: > 40%

-- D: > 20%
  
-- E: <= 20%

### Differential values

In the overall section now you will see a section with the **differential values for the main metrics since a given 
period**. 

There are three periods by default (since the first analysis, since six months ago, since last month), but if you prefer, 
you can set a specific date. Just add "-Dactivity.period=" to your command with the values:

-- 0 (since first analysis) Default value

-- 1 (since six months ago)

-- 2 (since last month)

-- YYYY-MM-DD (since specified date)

### Quality gates

Now in the project breakdown section you will be able to see for each project the quality gate status 
and a new section with the activity for the given period.
