**Have you ever thought of gather SonarQube projects? What about being able to compare coverage of two or more sonarqube projects?**  
Many sonar users and managers need to check code quality status of different projects. This can be a real challenge on large SonarQube instances. 

**Having a portfolio of projects is the easiest way to compare them.** But not only that, gathering and classifying projects is the only chance to have a quick and visual overview of the code quality of your organisation. 

* Do you want to know which of your software providers is doing best? Just group all the projects under "Software factory" portfolio or create a portfolio of each provider.

* Do you need to reach a zero-vulnerability objective for your client-side apps? Group all the sonarqube projects that are included onto this category and just focus on them. Take away noise from your sonar management dashboard. 

* What about analysing the performance of teams after a mayor change in its processes/tools? Compare the results of different methodologies. 

There are many more examples of portfolios: languages (Java, PHP, Phyton...), teams, legacy, open source vs private, internal software...
