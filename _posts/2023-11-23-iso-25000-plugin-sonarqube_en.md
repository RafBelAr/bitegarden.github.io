Technology drives most activities at the enterprise level. Therefore, the **quality of software** has become an indispensable variable for organizations and, above all, for the **DevOps* departments. ISO 25000 emerged as a standard to ensure excellence in software development and maintenance. Therefore, in this article we will talk about the importance of software quality and how to achieve it with the SQALE plugin for SonarQube, which complies with the ISO 25000 standard.

## ISO 25000 as a software quality guide

ISO 25000 provides a guide for evaluating and managing software quality. It defines specific criteria that go beyond basic functionality, such as efficiency, reliability, usability and safety. Therefore, meeting these criteria is essential for the successful development of any application or software.

If you want to consult these criteria or to expand the information about ISO 25000, you can do so through this [link](https://normasiso.org/norma-iso-25000/). 

## SQALE method and ISO 25000

The SQALE method allows users to know the **technical debt of projects** and the characteristics of the code that accumulates the most debt. In addition, this method **complies with ISO 25000**. 
In previous editions, SonarQube had an extension that allowed managing technical debt with the SQALE method. After its elimination, at bitegarden we developed a plugin that recovers that functionality to help developers manage and reduce the technical debt of their projects.

We are talking about the SQALE plugin for SonarQube that is designed so that users know **what is generating the technical debt**, analyze it from a technical perspective and to establish a code optimization strategy. This solution is one more tool to ensure the quality of the software.
