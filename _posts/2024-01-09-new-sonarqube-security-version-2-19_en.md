We have released version 2.19 of the [Security Plugin for SonarQube&trade;](sonarqube-security) that adds the ISO5055
Not Supported and Passed CWE as breakdown to get more information both in web page and in PDF Report.

Also, we added the possibility to enable/disable the Not Passed CWE in the ISO5055 PDF Report.
<div style="width: 100%; display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: center">

</div>

In addition, we have modified the e-mail sent when an analysis have been done. Now, it will contain a link to project:
