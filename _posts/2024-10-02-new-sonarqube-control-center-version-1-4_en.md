We have a new release of the Control Center for SonarQube! In this article, we will tell you what you can find in **version 1.4**.

<h2>What are the new features?</h2>

This new version includes a **new section** where you can view all the Hotspots in the instance that have been resolved but without adding any comments, and it allows you to comment on them **in bulk**. Additionally, you can filter by project and by type of resolution.

In the image below, you can see an example of this **new functionality**:

<br>

Here you can see how a user can **select one or more hotspots** and add the same comment to all of them at once:
