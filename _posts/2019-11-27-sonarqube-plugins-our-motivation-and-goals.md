Bitegarden was born more than a year ago as a side project of a group of SonarQube professionals. We wanted to spread our knowledge and help with our experience as highly trained and specialised SonarQube consultants.  When we look back, it's hard to believe what we've achieved after a year. 
Now, a new challenge it's coming and we are decided to overcome it. Bitegarden plugins for SonarQube are not a side project anymore, but a niche product company that is ready to grow and escalate.

We love SonarQube and we believe it's the best static analyser tool out there. But in this industry, even when we only focus on a specific tool,  there is always room for personalisation, added functionalities or simply difficulty to justify payment of an open-source and free tool as SonarQube.


Years working with SonarQube and collaborating in forums, events and communities, have resulted in an extensive knowledge of the whole ecosystem. We identified a series of missing abilities, room for improvement and better practices within the tool itself. 
But at the same time, **we observed how development teams taking the most out of SonarQube improved the quality of their software day by day. We've seen the impact that SonarQube have on developing better and safer code.** We love their approach and we completely share it: sonar is a developer centered tool, which helps developers develop better software.

With that in mind, we decided that our products we'll be exclusively based on extending SonarQube capabilities. And that's basically what we do: **we create plugins for SonarQube that makes this static code analyser more tailored to the needs of each specific team.**



## SonarQube plugins


Two great examples of the motivation behind Bitegarden are SQALE and Overview Report plugins. 

* [SQALE plugin for SonarQube™](https://www.bitegarden.com/sonarqube-sqale) brings back a software quality model that used to be present on SonarQube previous versions. The SQALE method is focused on Technical Debt management and it's compliant to ISO 25000, so not only our plugin fits the needs of those who are missing SQALE on SonarQube, but of those who are looking for a specific, certified and effective methodology to improve software quality. **SQALE Plugin for SonarQube™ is listed as an official SQALE tool to manage your technical debt**. 


* [Overview Report Plugin for SonarQube™](https://www.bitegarden.com/sonarqube-overview) responds to one of the most asked functionalities: gather sonarqube projects together creating one or more portfolios for a better evaluation of overall quality of software within an organisation.

## Plugin documentation and directory

What's to come in the near future?

We are working on improving the documentation of all our products (this blog will help as well towards this goal) whilst improving their abilities and even we have in mind some new plugins!

**The final goal is to put Bitegarden as a referent in the SonarQube ecosystem allowing more teams to grow using this incredible static analysis tool for code. We want to be the primary plugin directory for SonarQube and become a trustful partner for all code quality lovers.**

Stay tuned!
