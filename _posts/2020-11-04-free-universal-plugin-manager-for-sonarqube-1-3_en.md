The new [**Universal Plugin Manager for SonarQube**](/en/sonarqube-upm) is available. Now you can manage your plugins from the main SonarQube panel.

### New features

<br/>

#### User installed plugins

It shows a list of all the plugins that have been installed and that are not available in the SonarQube marketplace, allowing deleting.

#### Version management

-- If you install a plugin that already exists, the Universal Plugin Manager checks the version and informs about the updating.

-- Show all the new releases of the bitegarden plugins and give a description of what the new version includes (in addition to giving the possibility to update it if they are already present).

#### Other improvements

- Allows to revert the changes made (plugin installation, update and / or uninstallation).

- Restart button: the server automatically refreshes the page when it is available again.

- The license agreement is added to the list of plugins.
