Great news! We have just released the new version (2.9.1) of the [Report Plugin for SonarQube](/sonarqube-report).

This version will allow you to receive the reports of your project **by e-mail**!
 
## New feature

You can finally set an e-mail notification after a successful analysis, and if you have entered a list of recipients for a project (or globally), the system will take care of sending an email notification including links to download the reports.

Amazing, right?

## Download the new version

Get what you need without thinking about it, download the new Report for SonarQube now!


The Report Plugin is available for download through the [Update Center](/downloads/#call-to-action) or from the [Download page](/downloads).
