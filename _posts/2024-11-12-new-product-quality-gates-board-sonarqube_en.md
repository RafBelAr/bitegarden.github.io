¡We have a new product! The development team has been working on a **new plugin for SonarQube server** that we tell you about today. We are pleased to present **Quality Gates Board for SonarQube**. Let’s talk about it here!

<h2>What is Quality Gates Board for SonarQube?</h2>

Quality Gates for SonarQube is a plugin that will allow you to **check a new page within a project** to see if it passes **one or more quality thresholds**. Currently, SonarQube server does not allow to validate the code against several thresholds. A situation that prevents **managing correctly the level of quality** that is to be achieved in organizations, because it is not possible to know whether or not a project meets different levels. SonarQube server only allows you to know if **meets a Quality Gate**. 

Therefore, the development team of bitegarden has designed this plugin so that, through a simple **page, you can see what quality thresholds** a project meets. With this solution you can configure more than one Quality Gate to be able to **view the compliance** on this new page without leaving your project.

Here is an example image of a page that we have set up with different quality thresholds:

To access this new page you will need to go to the project you want and display the section **'More' and click on 'Quality Gates Board'***. It opened a page with quality thresholds as you can see in the previous image.
