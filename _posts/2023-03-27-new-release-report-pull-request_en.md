We have a new version of the [bitegarden Report for SonarQube](/sonarqube-report)!

This version adds support for Pull Request in all reports.

With Pull Request support, users can get detailed information about code changes before merging them into the master branch.

The ability to analyze code changes before merging them into the master branch can help teams reduce bug fix time in the future.


In addition to Pull Request support, the new version of bitegarden Report for SonarQube also includes a number of internal improvements and bug fixes.
