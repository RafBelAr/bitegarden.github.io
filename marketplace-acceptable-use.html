                    Here at bitegarden, our goal is to help you and your team do the
                    best work of your lives, every day. To do this, we need to keep our products and services running
                    smoothly,
                    quickly, and without distraction. For this to happen, we need help from you, our users. We need you
                    not to
                    misuse or abuse our products and services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To describe exactly what we mean by “misuse” or “abuse” – and help us identify such transgressions
                    and
                    react accordingly – we’ve created this Acceptable Use Policy. Under this policy, we reserve the
                    right to
                    take action if we see objectionable content that is inconsistent with the spirit of the guidelines,
                    even if
                    it’s something that is not forbidden by the letter of the policy. In other words, if you do
                    something that
                    isn’t listed here verbatim, but it looks or smells like something listed here, we may still take
                    action.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You’ll see the word “services” a lot throughout this page. That refers to all products and websites
                    owned
                    or operated by bitegarden, and any related websites, sub-domains and pages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Use your judgment, and let’s be kind to each other so we can keep creating great things. You can
                    find all
                    the legal fine print at the bottom of this page.

                    as:

                    normal browser
